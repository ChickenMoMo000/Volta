# Volta
IOT / VMS
This project i named volta covers the basic fundamentals of iot system i've used devices like esp32, arduino uno, relay, oled for data display and other electronic components.
This project is done to counter the problem of high voltage spikes in house hold and prevent the future damage.
what this project is doing is its basically monitoring the voltage level across a source and the load. a circuit divider made of 2 resistors are responsible for sending the data of voltage to arduino and arduino calculates the voltage across the circuit with a voltage divider equation and here i've implemented the serial communication between esp32 and arduino we can just use esp32. But here i established a  serial communication between two devices (TX & RX) communication and the arduino sends voltage data to esp32 and esp32  acts as the server which sends data to my mobile phone here i've used blynk iot for easiness and quick setup and when the signal sent by arduino is more then the set  threshold then user gets alert notification and mail in their phone showing the time and the level of voltage. and if user didn't respond for few seconds it will automatically cut the connection and relay module is responsible for doing so. if user encounters the  notification he or she can simply cut the power by themselves form the app.
